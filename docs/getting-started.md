# Getting Started

## Installation

To get started with a new project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new project** by running the following command:

   ```sh
   pnpm create sweyn@latest <app-name>
   ```

   Replace `<app-name>` with the name you want for your project.

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:

   ```sh
   cd <app-name>
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:3003`.
